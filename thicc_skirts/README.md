# Thicc skirts for Voron V2
Extended skirts to look nicer and make the screen more readable with the [awesome Clicky Clack door mod](https://github.com/tanaes/whopping_Voron_mods/tree/main/clickyclacky_door)

There are versions for 300mm and 350mm V2s

To save material and not require supports, the new skirts attach to small "brackets" attached to the original extrusion.

## BOM

| **Item**                     | **Qty**    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| **M3x5x4 Heatset Insert**    | **8**      |
| **M3x8 SHCS**                | **14**     | 

## Printing

Parts should be oriented correctly in the STLs. No need for standard Voron settings, as these are non-functional parts. I used 5 top and bottom layers, 4 walls, 15% infill
