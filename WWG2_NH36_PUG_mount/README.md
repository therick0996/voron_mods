# WWG2 NH36/EBB36 mount for PUG

I find [PUG](https://www.printables.com/model/378567-pug-parametric-umbilical-gland) to be far superior to PG7 mounts, so made this guy.

Additionally, the NH36 connector sticks up really high, so this also lowers the cable a bit. 

This is based off [tetsu and Thor's existing canboard mounts](https://github.com/tetsu97/WristWatch-G2-Extruder/blob/main/CAD/WWG2_canboard_mounts.step)

To be used with [WristWatch G2](https://github.com/tetsu97/WristWatch-G2-Extruder/tree/main)
